## Data preparation (for PLS regression):


`model.matrix()` is from the `{stats}` package, 

* Factors are expanded to a set of dummy variables.


`plsr()` function from the `{pls}` package needs regression input in matrix $\mathbf{X}$ and vector $\mathbf{y}$ form.

```{r}
X <-  model.matrix(Salary~., Hitters)[ , -1]
y <- Hitters$Salary
```


## Partial least squares regression

* regression formula is provided `y ~ X`  
* number of components used in the regression  
* $k$FCV validation (`CV` or `LOO` may be used)  
* classical orthogonal scores algorithm (`method = "oscorespls"`) is chosen (other methods are available).
* use scaling of the variables


#### The number of components used in PLS may be established as follows

```{r}
PLS1 <- plsr(y ~ X, ncomp = 10, validation = "CV", method = "oscorespls", scale=T)
summary(PLS1)
```


* The validation results here are **Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP)**. 

* `CV` is the ordinary CV estimate, 
* `adjCV` is a [bias-corrected CV estimate.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cem.887)  
  + text not publicly available...

--- 

It is often simpler to judge the RMSEPs by plotting them:

```{r}
plot(RMSEP(PLS1), legendpos = "topright")
selectNcomp(PLS1, method = "onesigma", plot = TRUE)
```

---

Once the number of components has been chosen, one can inspect different aspects of the fit by plotting predictions, scores, loadings, etc.

```{r}
# Prediction plot:
plot(PLS1, ncomp = 1, asp = 1, line = TRUE)
# For comparison, if predictions are based on 4 components
plot(PLS1, ncomp = 4, asp = 1, line = TRUE)
#
# Other summarizing/informative plots may be shown using the "plottype" argument
# 
# Score plots are often used to look for patterns, groups or outliers in the data:
#    The numbers in parentheses are the relative amount of X matrix
#    variance explained by each component. 
plot(PLS1, plottype = "scores", comps = 1:4)
#
#The explained variances in X can be extracted explicitly:
explvar(PLS1)[1:4]
#
# The loading plot is used for interpretation purposes, 
# for instance to look for known spectral peaks or profiles
plot(PLS1, "loadings", comps = 1:4, legendpos = "bottomleft",xlab = "X-matrix variables (column id)")
abline(h = 0)
```

--- 

### Predictions from PLS-estimated models are available:

```{r}
Pred1<- predict(PLS1, ncomp = 1)
# Note: if you increase "ncomp", variability of predictions increases.
cbind(Hitters$Salary,Pred1)[1:10,]
```

---- 

## Quick exercise:

* Use PLS to predict **house prices** using the `Hedonic` dataset from `{Ecdat}` package:

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, include=F}
require(Ecdat)
```

#### Dataset preparation

```{r}
mydataset <- Hedonic
# ?Hedonic
# mv (median value of owner?occupied homes) is our dependent variable
X.train <-  model.matrix(mv~., mydataset)[1:500 , -1]
y.train <- mydataset$mv[1:500]
X.test  <- model.matrix(mv~., mydataset)[501:506 , -1]
y.test  <- mydataset$mv[501:506]
#
# Combine y and X into a data.frame object
DF.train <- data.frame(y = I(matrix(y.train,nrow = 500)), X=I(matrix(X.train,nrow = 500)))
DF.test  <- data.frame(y = I(matrix(y.test,nrow = 6)), X=I(matrix(X.test,nrow = 6)))
str(DF.train)
str(DF.test)
```

#### Task 1 

* Estimate the `pslr()` object, use a maximum of 8 components
* Use the `data=DF.train` argument

```{r}
# HousePLS <- pslr()
```


#### Task 2 

* Use the `selectNcomp()` to choose an optimal number of components

```{r}
# 
```


#### Task 3 

* Plot loading for the first 3 components

```{r}
# 
```


#### Task 4 

* Use the estimated model to predict house prices ("mv") for the test sample
* .. You need to use the `newdata=` argument
* Use cbind to show actual and predicted values 

```{r}
# Pred.mv <- 
# cbind()
```
