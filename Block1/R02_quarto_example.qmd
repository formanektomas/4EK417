## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

--- 

$\LaTeX$ can be implemented the same way as in `Rmd` files:

* `$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t + \varepsilon_t$`  
* generates  
* $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t + \varepsilon_t$

#### Estimation and plotting:

- Again, similar to Markdown, with added features  



```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```


Using the `#|label: fig-airquality` handle, you can reference the figure in your text, by includig `@fig-airquality` cross-reference. For example: 

* @fig-airquality describes air quality.
