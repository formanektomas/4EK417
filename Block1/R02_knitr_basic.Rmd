# Outline of this script:

* R Markdown - quick review of the `.Rmd` format and functionality
* R basics for the course 4EK417

## R Markdown - quick review 

> This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

For a simple cheatsheet, go to: `RStudio: File > Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet`  

When you *click* the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can hide the `summary(cars)` R code from the knitted output:
(this is done using the `echo=FALSE` parameter)  

Note: two empty spaces at the end of a line force a line return

* Lists are insterted using `*`
* Horizontal lines `---`
* Headings are produced using `#`, `##`, etc. 
* Math expression are inserted through $\LaTeX$ syntax: `$\hat{\beta}_1$` translates to $\hat{\beta}_1$, `$\sigma_i^2$` becomes $\sigma_i^2$, etc.

# Heading 1
is produced using `# Heading 1`,  

## Heading 2  
is produced using `## Heading 2`, etc.  

### Heading 3  

-----

#### `R` code \& output can be inserted using code "chunks":  


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Additional information on the data:
```{r, echo=T}
str(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=T}
plot(cars)
```

Alternatively, you can hide the plot command `plot(cars)` from the `html` output, using `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Quick exercise

1. Estimate and save a linear regression model `mpg <- f(hp,wt,vs)` using the `mtcars` dataset from the `{datasets}` package.  

2. Print the estimation results (regression table) and provide interpretation.  

3. Test for heteroskedasticity (e.g. Breusch-Pagan test from the `{lmtest}` package).  

4. Show diagnostic plots for the estimated model and provide interpretation.  


```{r}


```

### Markdown use in the course 4EK417:  

**All home assignments for the course shall be submitted in the `Rmd` format**, with `echo=TRUE` set for all `R` chunks.

## R basics for the course 4EK417 

Required/assumed `R` knowledge and skills (and references to self-study materials, if necessary)

1. Basic `R` syntax, working with common objects such as vectors, dataframes, matrices. Referencing styles: `[,]` and `$`. Reading and writing `csv` and similar data formats. Linear regression in `R` & corresponding tests.  
    + `R03_basic_data_handling.R` as in Block 1.  
    + Any text or course located on [Stack Overflow for R](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info)
    
2. Basic knowledge of data plotting using `graphics` and `ggplot2` packages.  
    + `R05_ggplot2.R` as in Block 1.  
    + [ggplot2 web page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) 
    
3. Basic knowledge of time series handling within `R`, with some focus on the `zoo` package. 
    + [quick reference for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/vignettes/zoo-quickref.pdf)  


##### Additional data handling tools and functions - necessary for this course - will be discussed in Block 1.  

+ For data handling, the `R` scripts provided in this course are based `tideverse` packages (mostly `tidyr` and `dplyr`).  
+ If you are used to other tools (say, you want to use `data.table` functions in a home assignment), it is not a problem.
