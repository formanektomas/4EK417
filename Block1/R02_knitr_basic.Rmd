This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

For a simple cheatsheet, go to: `RStudio: File > Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet`  

When you *click* the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can hide the `summary(cars)` R code from the knitted output:
(this is done using the `echo=FALSE` parameter)  
Note: two empty spaces at the end of a line force a line return

* Lists are insterted using `*`
* Horizontal lines `---`
* Headings are produced using `#`, `##`, etc. 
* Math expression are inserted through $\LaTeX$ syntax: `$\hat{\beta}_1$` translates to $\hat{\beta}_1$, `$\sigma_i^2$` becomes $\sigma_i^2$, etc.

## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Another `R` code \& output goes here:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Additional information on the data:
```{r, echo=T}
str(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=T}
plot(cars)
```

Alternatively, you can hide the plot command `plot(cars)` from the `html` output, using `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Quick exercise

1. Estimate and save a linear regression model `mpg <- f(hp,wt,vs)` using the `mtcars` dataset from the `{datasets}` package.  

2. Print the estimation results (regression table) and provide interpretation.  

3. Test for heteroskedasticity (e.g. Breusch-Pagan test from the `{lmtest}` package).  

4. Show diagnostic plots for the estimated model and provide interpretation.  


```{r}


```
